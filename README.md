# Team Profile Generator

  ## Description

  Every organization needs a fast and efficient way to build a employee directory. This program was built for a busy HR professional that needs a way to build a quick employee directory web page. The goal of this app should be to reduce the amount of time it takes some one to build out a directory. This app uses a variety of CS functionality, I ended up having to learn many things including OOP and regex to complete this app.

  ## Usage

  As an HR professional, once you run the file the program will answer a series of questions about your team. The program will ask for a manager to start, it will then ask you for the other types of team members you are looking to add. You may choose between engineer and intern. Once you choose an option the program will ask you a series of questions about that employee. Once you complete that question it will ask you if you want to add another person. Once you are done select I am finished and the program will write your file to the dist directory.
